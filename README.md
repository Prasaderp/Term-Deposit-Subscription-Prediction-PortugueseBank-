# Bank Term Deposit Prediction

## ðŸš€ Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model for identifying customers who are likely to sign up for a term deposit, in order to assist a Portuguese bank in improving its revenue by targeting potential clients for cross-selling products like funds and insurance.

## ðŸ”§ Steps Involved
1. **Data Understanding & Preparation**: Explored and cleaned the provided dataset.
2. **Feature Selection & Encoding**: Identified and transformed relevant features using One-Hot Encoding.
3. **Imbalance Handling**: Applied SMOTE to balance the dataset for better model performance.
4. **Data Standardization**: Standardized data for training the models.
5. **Model Building**: Implemented and evaluated models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost.

## ðŸ“Š Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
